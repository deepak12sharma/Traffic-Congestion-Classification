This repository contains a partial implementation of our project, showcasing essential components and functionality. The code includes the necessary imports and highlights some key functions used in the project.

Key Functions

1. load_images_and_labels(data_path, cates)
     Purpose: This function is responsible for resizing the loaded images and converting them into tensors for further 
     processing.


2.cnn_generate()
     Purpose: Defines the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

3.train_model(model, X_train, X_test, y_test, epochs, batch_size)
     Purpose: Utilizes the CNN model to create a feature extraction map and trains it with the specified parameters.
